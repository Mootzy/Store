 *                  *********************************************
 * !! The 'add to cart' button demonstrates updating qty of object.
 * Currently this only works for NIKE-SHIRT as it is hardcoded to update userInventory[0]
 * Reguardless of which option added to cart.
 * need to find way to pass value of selected radio button to the actionEvent "AddToCartAction"
 * So that it knows which item to 1( multiplied by however many user adds to cart) from qty.
 *
 *
 *				Update @ 6:49pm ---
 * The button correctly reads the value of the selected element.
 * Currently, ONLY WORKS FOR ONE SELECTION NOT MULTIPLE AT A TIME.
 * Added ability to subtract from qty and add to sales respectively.
 *
 *TODO: add ArrayList to keep track of customers cart, maybe add an updating variable in frame to denote total number of items in cart.
 * look to next section
